This is intended dor those preparing an MS4W and OSGEO4W packages 


PACKAGING FOR OSGEO4W
---------------------

 1- the final package (.tar.bz2) have the following directory structure:
   
   apache
     ---- htdocs
       ---------- ms_ogc_workshop.pkg.html
   apps
     ---- ms_ogc_workshop
   
   etc
    ------ posinstall
       -------- ms_ogc_workshop.bat

   httpd.d
     ------- httpd_ms_ogc_workshop.conf

 * apache folder is for ms_ogc_workshop.pkg.html

 * apps folder
    - contains a sub folder called ms_ogc_workshop and this sub folder contains
      all the files of workshop (as you would get it from cvs)

 * etc folder (with the ini and postinstall folders) contain a file called ms_ogc_workshop.bat. This file is
   included in cvs in the workshop. The ms_ogc_workshop.bat is run after the installation is done.
   Note sure at this point if both sub filders are needed or just one of them.

 * httpd.d folder is for httpd_ms_ogc_workshop.conf

  These folders will be extracted into the root directory of the osgeo4w installation. Example
  c:\OSGeo4W\apps\ms_ogc_workshop ...


 2- Create 'ms_ogc_workshop.pdf'
 
  Use OpenOffice to convert 'ms_ogc_workshop.ppt' to a PDF and also include it in the 
  /doc folder of the package.

 3- Naming of the package

  The convention is to name the package using the package name and the version 
  (example :ms_ogc_workshop-1.0.9-1.tar.bz2)
  
 4- excluding CVS folders
 
  Use the tar '--exclude CVS' option to make sure the CVS folders are not included in the 
  package.

 5- setup.hint
 
 For each osgeo4w package, there is a setup.hint attached to it. This files has information such
 as the full name of the package and the required packages.
 setup.hint is is included in cvs


 6- Where to upload the package

 The main site is http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/release/ms_ogc_workshop/ 

 Please also check http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ for details on OSGeo4W 
 

 7- package command

  $ tar -cvjf ms_ogc_workshop-1.0.10.5-1.tar.bz2 --exclude CVS apps/ms_ogc_workshop etc/postinstall/ms_ogc_workshop.bat apache/htdocs/ms_ogc_workshop.pkg.html httpd.d/httpd_ms_ogc_workshop.conf



PACKAGING FOR MS4W
-------------------


 1- the final package (.zip) have the following directory structure:
   
   apache
     ---- htdocs
       ---------- ms_ogc_workshop.pkg.html
   apps
     ---- ms_ogc_workshop
   
   httpd.d
     ------- httpd_ms_ogc_workshop.conf

 * apache folder is for ms_ogc_workshop.pkg.html

 * apps folder
    - contains a sub folder called ms_ogc_workshop and this sub folder contains
      all the files of workshop (as you would get it from cvs)

 * httpd.d folder is for httpd_ms_ogc_workshop.conf

  These folders will be extracted into the root directory where ms4w is installed. 


2 - Converting files from CVS version to ms4w ready files

    Several files extracted directly from CVS contain @osgeo4w@ tags instead of the disk paths such as /ms4w.
    (The reason for that is that these tags are used during the OSGEO4W installation  and replace by the
    appropriate path where OSGEO4W is installed.)
  
    For an ms4w package, we also need to replace those tags with /ms4w. Steps to do that are:

      - get the   ms_ogc_workshop from CVS
      - get the textrepalce.exe binary from http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/release/msvcrt/
      - run the ms_ogc_workshop_ms4w.bat   

3 - Create 'ms_ogc_workshop.pdf'
 
    Use OpenOffice to convert 'ms_ogc_workshop.ppt' to a PDF and also include it in the 
    /doc folder of the package.

4 - excluding CVS folders
 
    Use the tar '--exclude CVS' option to make sure the CVS folders are not included in the 
    package.
